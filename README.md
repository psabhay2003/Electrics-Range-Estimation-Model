# Electrics-Range-Estimation-Model
Electtrics Range Estimation Model predicts how far an electric vehicle(EV) can travel on a full charge. Electric Vehicle(EV) buyers and manufacturers need an accurate way to estimate the expected electric range of an EV based on its specifications. Thus, making this a useful estimation model for both buyers and manufacturers.
The prime objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the expected electric range based on given data and features such as EV type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle(CAFV) eligibility, and others.
